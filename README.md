### About This Version

Atsuko (Legacy) is a Python-based Discord bot designed with extensibility in mind. It featured:

- A dynamic cog system for modular feature additions  
- A custom help interface  
- Prefix-based command structure (now deprecated)  
- A basic auto-restart script (`Watcher.py`) for uptime management

This version served as a foundation but is now outdated and no longer maintained.
